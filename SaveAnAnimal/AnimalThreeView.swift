However, due to urban planning and agricultural expansion in the U.S. and Canada, millions of acres of milkweed have been paved over and plowed, ultimately decreasing the monarch's population. The impacts of habitat destruction, insecticides, and herbicides within the Monarch Butterflies' breeding grounds, along with the effects of climate change, are the main drivers in the monarchâ€™s decline today.")
